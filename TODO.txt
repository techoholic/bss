~modify keyboard and mouse libraries so they only have the functions I need
~fix line spacing throughout the program
~implement error handling
~make a GUI or compile this into an executable
~think of a more descriptive name
~make .pkr and other files smaller and fix weird naming of attributes (event.count -> event.data)
~modify the libraries to stop recording the mouse when a different event happens
~modify the libraries so there is no need for s second script
~interact with the background script through Popen/this script instead of sync.sqs
~add keymapper to remap keys to certain characters / also possibly switch between reading the characters and reading the keys?
