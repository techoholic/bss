# 2023 Update: Introduction of BusyBee!

Hello everyone, (well, the four people watching that might see this) hope you have having a great Beesmas/Christmas/holdiay time! So um, as you can see its been over 2 years since I've updated the Sequencer because to be honest, I've found more success and reliablility in using this script to perform a very basic AFK routine: jump every few seconds. This means that I don't use it for anything fancy, so no more updates until I need it to do fancy things (walk around claiming planters, killing mobs, doing puffshrooms, etc).
However, I have not been dormant in Bee Swarm nor Visual Studio. I would like to introduce... **BusyBee**! Remember the "Reminder.py" script I added to this repo? Well, I made a similar program I have christened "BusyBee". It's a simple GUI that displays all of the timers in Bee Swarm, so you never forget to claim your Samovar, or kill your Tunnel Bear. If you would like to check it out, I just published it over at https://github.com/techoholic/busybee. Hope this is helpful for some people!
Ok see you guys later byeee

Welcome to my repository for **The Sequencer**: a script that helps you progress AFK in various games (made for Onett's Bee Swarm Simulator on Roblox). Basically, you can record your keypresses (or mouse movements), and then make a program to play them back a certain amount of times, with waits and special mouse events. For example, you could record yourself collecting honey from a field, returning to your hive to make honey, and then going back to the field to repeat the process.

The program to run to make all of this cool stuff happen is **sequencer.bat**. A reminder that this requires Python to be installed on your computer to run the script, but if you don't have that, an executable version is in the works -- just you wait. This script and other parts of this repository are actively being worked on so make sure to check back frequently!

UPDATE ON ERROR HANDLING: I'm actually trying to make errors not crash the program now, so if you experience any error-related crashes or bugs in general, kindly create an *Issue* in the __Issues__ tab of this repo.

**This project wouldn't be possible without boppreh's keyboard & mouse libraries, pynput, and win10toast ;)**
