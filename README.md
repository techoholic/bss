**RUNNING THE PYTHON SCRIPTS REQUIRE PYTHON 3 AND THE KEYBOARD PYTHON LIBRARY (pip install keyboard)**

Hey guys, Techoholic here! Welcome to my repository for scripts that help you progress AFK in various games (made for Onett's Bee Swarm Simulator on Roblox). All it does record keypresses and play them back in customizable ways. For example, you could record yourself collecting honey from a field, returning to your hive to make honey, and then going back to the field to repeat the process. 

The main script used to do all of this is **sequencer.py**. This script and other parts of this repository are actively being worked on so make sure to check back frequently!
