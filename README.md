**RUNNING THE PYTHON SCRIPTS REQUIRE PYTHON 3! Also, this project wouldn't be possible without boppreh's keyboard & mouse libraries ;)**

A MESSAGE: Hello and happy November to the one or two people watching this repo. I haven't worked on this at all because of school BUT I will be getting back to it soon, I promise. That's it, that's the entire update, have a nice day and stay tuned!

Hey guys, Techoholic here! Welcome to my repository for scripts that help you progress AFK in various games (made for Onett's Bee Swarm Simulator on Roblox). All it does record keypresses and play them back in customizable ways. For example, you could record yourself collecting honey from a field, returning to your hive to make honey, and then going back to the field to repeat the process. 

The program to run to make all of this cool stuff happen is **sequencer.bat**. This script and other parts of this repository are actively being worked on so make sure to check back frequently! I am going to turn my sequencer into a desktop application very soon.

WARNING: I didn't feel like adding much error handling so if the program exits with an error, you probably entered something wrong :D
